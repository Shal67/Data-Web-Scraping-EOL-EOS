### Project Title:Data Web-Scrapping (EOL/EOS) 



#### Overview:

This Python script automates the process of web scraping data from multiple URLs and storing the extracted information into a SQLite database. Specifically, it extracts version-related data from various websites using Selenium, a popular web automation tool.

#### Prerequisites:

1. **Python:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Chrome WebDriver:** The script uses Chrome WebDriver for web automation. Make sure to download the appropriate version for your Chrome browser from [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and update the `chrome_driver_path` variable in the script with the correct path to the ChromeDriver executable.

3. **Required Python Packages:** Install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   pip install selenium asyncio concurrent.futures
   ```

#### How to Use:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Update Chrome WebDriver Path:**
   Open the Python script (`script.py`) and update the `chrome_driver_path` variable with the correct path to your ChromeDriver executable.

3. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   python script.py
   ```

4. **Database Output:**
   The scraped data will be stored in a SQLite database named `A.db`. You can find the extracted information in the corresponding tables named `ruby_versions`, `python_versions`, `alpine_versions`, `postgresql_versions`, `kindle_versions`, and `vmware_cloud_foundation_versions`.

#### Additional Notes:

- **Concurrency:** The script utilizes asynchronous programming and concurrent execution to scrape data from multiple URLs concurrently, making the process faster and more efficient.

- **Error Handling:** The script handles basic errors related to web scraping, such as element not found or invalid URLs. However, it's essential to ensure a stable internet connection and the availability of the websites being scraped.

- **Data Structure:** The extracted data is structured into columns such as `version`, `release_date`, `end_of_life_date`, and `latest`. These columns correspond to the attributes of the products or versions being scraped.
